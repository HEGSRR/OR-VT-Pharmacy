## Alternative study versions

Several alternative reports are available for alternative study versions using different study parameters. These are available below for comparison to the original study and check on sensitivity and robustness. 
These reports were generated with the `02_Study_Variations.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

Additionally, any two sets of study results can be compared with the `03_Compare_Results.ipynb` Jupyter notebook, and selected comparison links are included below.
