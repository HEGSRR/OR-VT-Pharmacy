    "\n",
    "Function written by Joe Holler + Derrick Burt. A more efficient way to calculate distance-weighted catchment areas for each hospital. First, create a dictionary (with a node and its corresponding drive time from the hospital) of all nodes within a 30 minute drive time (using networkx single_cource_dijkstra_path_length function). From here, two more dictionaries are constructed by querying the original one. From these dictionaries, single part convex hulls are created for each drive time interval and appended into a single list (one list with 3 polygon geometries). Within the list, the polygons are differenced from each other to produce three catchment areas.\n",

    "Extensive cleaning of unneccesary variables and lines of code that were never called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making code more efficient and easier to read with GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Made the __pop_centroid__ function much faster - preciosly took 3:30 to run, now less than a second. Instead of creating an empty GDF and iterating over all of the population geometries, adding data to this new GDF, I just used the native GeoPandas centroid method, replacing the population geometries with centroids, and then dropping other unnecessary columns from atrisk_data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rewrote the __hospital_setting__ function to find each hospital's nearest node using GeoPandas nearest join method. What took 1:20 to run now runs in less than a second. I also cleaned the GDF so that it matched what we were working with before. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Removed parallel processing from two functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __overlapping_function__\n",
    "2. __measure_acc_par__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Changes to the methodology\n",

    "Area weighted reaggregation - \n",
    "assigned speeds to the road network using osnmx. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifying Code for future students\n",
    "\n",
    "My greatest contribution to this replication has been the simplification of code and adding documentation to functions. This has made the code much easier for future students to read through and understand, and has not sacrificed processing times. I also made a visual workflow, visualizing the replication study from start to finish, including all data and functions used to manipulate them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifications include:\n",
    "\n",
    "I removed the dropdown menu that allows you to choose between population groups and hospital data. The benefits of this dropdown options were minimal, and it just made the code more confusing to follow and modify. In the form of a dropdown selection, it prevents the study from being one script, and introduces potential error as groups try to replicate eachother, if they are not clear about which choices they made with their mouse in the dropdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to delete the function __overlap_calc__, after implementing its function into __overlapping_function__ which was implements the area weighted reaggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I removed a code block that filtered rows where the \"hospital_icu_beds\" value is infinity, which did not do anything. \n",
