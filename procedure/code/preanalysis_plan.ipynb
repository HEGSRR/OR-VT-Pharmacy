    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacy care is a fundamental aspect of primary healthcare and is gaining greater recognition in the healthcare landscape. Recent research has underscored the importance of pharmacy access in primary care, as pharmacies are visited at higher rates than primary care providers and are particularly valuable for reaching rural populations. We aim to measure spatiotemporal variation in access to pharmacy care across the state of Vermont using the enhanced 2-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. Specifically, we seek to identify areas that have particularly limited access to pharmacies. This research is temporally explicit, as it will analyze variation in accessibility at specific times of the day and days of the week. Such temporally granular data has benefits for the research since it provides information on how spatial accessibility varies at irregular times, improving our understanding of when pharmacy care is particularly limited for certain populations. Results will be depicted as a series of spatial accessibility maps, covering diverse temporal extents to capture variations in pharmacy working hours. Previous studies have used the two step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the E2SFCA method to measure spatial accessibility of pharmacy care across geographic scales and regions. To our knowledge, this is the first temporally-explicit study of pharmacy care, and the first E2SFCA study of pharmacy accessibility in Vermont. The results of this study are of interest to service providers and Vermont state public health officials and may have important implications for public health planning in the state. \n",

    "This study adapts and extends the methodology used in Kang et al.'s (2020) \"Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA\" to measure spatial accessibility of pharmacy care across Vermont. \n",

    "## Study design\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study represents original research employing the Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method to assess spatial and temporal dimensions of pharmacy accessibility across Vermont. Holler et al. (2022) previously [reproduced Kang et al.'s (2020) study](https://osf.io/n92v3/) on spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources in Illinois, USA. Our research extends the the foundational code from this reproduction study, making relevant changes for our analysis. While retaining the core methodology, we make geographic adjustments, such as modifying the geographic area of interest and spatial resolution of accessibility measurements. We also introduce temporal considerations for a more nuanced analysis of pharmacy access. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study is an observational study that employs a descriptive model, based upon the E2SFCA method, first developed by Luo and Qi (2009) to measure spatial accessibility to primary care physicians. Since then, this method has been widely adopted to measure the spatial accessibility to a wide range of services; still, it appears to primarily be used to address access to healthcare resources.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching objective of this study is to understand how access to pharmacy care varies spatiotemporally across Vermont. This investigation is primarily driven by the hypothesis that rural populations across Vermont experience increased difficulty in accessing pharmacy services,  particularly beyond the conventional 9 am to 5 pm business hours on weekdays. We will conduct multiple runs of a spatial accessibility model at varying times of day and days of the week (temporally-explicitly) in order to describe how general variation in spatial access is impacted throughout a given week. Generally, results will be depicted in series of spatial accesibility maps. Three primary research questions and hypotheses arise from studying temporally explicit spatial accessibility of pharmacy care in Vermont. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Geographical Variation: Do certain areas of the state exhibit particularly limited access to pharmacy care?\n",
    "    - H1: Rural towns have relatively limited access to pharmacy care when compared to microplitan and metroplitan towns. \n",
    "    - H1 Null: There is no significant difference in access to pharmacy care among Vermont towns classified as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Temporal Fluctuations: How does the accessibility to pharmacies fluctuate across different temporal segments of the day, various days of  the week, or combinations of these temporal dimensions? \n",
    "    - H2: The accessibility to all pharmacies varies across temporal segments, including different times of the day, days of the week, and combinations of these temporal dimensions, with more limited access outside of typical 9 am to 5 pm weekday business hours.\n",
    "    - H2 Null: There is no significant difference in access between these temporal segments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Spatiotemporal: Presuming that we have observed differences in pharmacy accessibility in rural areas, are spatial differences in access exacerbated outside of conventional business hours? \n",
    "    - H3: Spatial differences in access will be exacerbated outside of the convetional weekday business hours, with larger differences arising at more extreme hours. \n",
    "    \n",
    "It is important to note that the classifications of metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural are based on town (county subdivision) geographical units, providing justification to use towns as the geographic units for the final maps in our study. Additionally, these units are politically meaningful, which also informed this decision.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses are based on the primary care accessibility literature, which has demonstrated urban-rural differences in access. It has also been shown that rural residents are less likely than their metropolitan counterparts to have usual source of care providers available during nights and weekends (Kirby & Yabroff, 2020). To assess our hypothesis regarding diminished spatial accessibility to pharmacy services for rural populations, we may utilize the ANOVA test (potentially weighted by population) to compare accessibility across metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural towns. This statistical test is commonly used to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups. We plan to use choropleth maps to illustrate the spatial variation in pharmacy access. Testing for statistically significant difference of means will also be used to determine whether accessibility varies temporally. However, it is decidedly more complex to run statistical tests that encapsulate the complexity of spatiotemporal variations in access to pharmacy care. As such, we may demonstrate our results in a more descriptive manner through comparing maps of accesibility over varying time extents for different geographic regions, or summarizing accessibility measures in interesting categories of the state for these various time extents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific time intervals for which we will measure accessibility have not yet been determined. However, it is likely that we will run the model for weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays generally, and then during time periods that are likely to pose accessibility issues to patients, such as early mornings (i.e. before 9 am), lunch hours, and evenings (i.e. after 6 pm). This temporal granularity aims to establish a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the spatial and temporal accessibility landscape of pharmacy care across the state of Vermont.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though there is some uncertainty in all that our analysis will entail, we are additionally interested in the relationship between social vulnerability and pharmacy access, as well as the impact that independent versus chain pharmacies have on the accessibility landscape. Considering Vermont's aging population and the elderly's increased reliance on pharmaceuticals, we are curious about the relationship between the presence of elderly populations and pharmacy access. To demonstrate these results, we envision creating scaterplots that compare percent elderly population in a town to the town's spatial accesibility measure and running linear regression tests weighted by population. It may alternately be possible to categorize the percentage of elderly in three categories (i.e. high, medium, low) and testing for significant difference of means of spatial accessibility between these groups.  By investigating these relationships, our study aims to explore some factors associated with pharmacy accessibility in Vermont, offering insights with potential additional implications for public health planning and resource allocation. \n",
