    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacy care is a fundamental aspect of primary healthcare and is gaining greater recognition in the healthcare landscape. Patient-pharmacist interactions have recently evolved beyond the conventional role of medication dispensing and have embraced a more patient-centric medication management role. Recent research has underscored the importance of pharmacy access in primary care, as patients tend to visit pharmacies at higher rates than primary care providers and pharmacies are particularly valuable for reaching rural populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research aims to measure the spatial variation in access to pharmacy care across the state of Vermont through adapting an established healthcare accessibility model encompassing the enhanced 2-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. Specifically, it seeks to identify areas of the state that have particularly limited access to pharmacies. This research is temporally explicit, as it will analyze variation in accessibility at specific times of the day and week. Such temporally granular data has added benefits for the research since it provides information on how spatial accessibility varies at irregular times, improving our understanding of when pharmacy care may be particularly limited for certain populations. Previous studies have used the two step floating catchment area (2SFCA) and the E2SFCA method to measure spatial accesibility of pharmacy care across geographic scales and regions (e.g. on both the state and national levels). However, no prior studies have done so in Vermont. The results of this study are of interest to both service providers and Vermont state public health officials and may have important implications for public health planning in the state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This study adapts and extends the methodology used in Kang et al.'s (2020) \"Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA\" to measure spatial accessibility of pharmacy care across Vermont. \n",

    "## Study design\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study is original research that adapts the method set forth by Kang et al. (2020) to measure spatial accesibility to COVID-19 healthcare resources. Specifically, we will adapt the supply variables and change our geographic area of interest but will largely follow the same methodology, with minor relevant changes for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Holler (include OSF link) previously reproduced the Kang et al. \n",
    "\n",
    "General research question This study is largerly a descriptive model that characterizes access to pharmacy care across the state. Importantly, the model will be run in a temporally explicit manner to describe how variation in access is impacted during a given week. Primary driver of this study was that rural populations across Vermont experience increased difficulty in . We hypothesize tha: Rural places have more significanlty limited access to pharmacy care, expecially outside of normal 9am-5pm monday through Friday business hours. Although this study does not address a specific hypothesis due to its descriptive nature, several specific research questions arise from studying temporally-explicit spatial accessibility of pharmacy care in Vermont. We are primarily interested in whether certain areas of the state have particularly limited access to pharmacy care. We are also interested in how access varies across certain times of the day, days of the week, or a combination of these. Are there gaps in spatial accesibility to pharmacy care in Vermont, especially at different times of the day or days of the week? This question can be answered with a temporally-explicit model that creates a series of maps demonstrating varying accesibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific time intervals for which we will measure accessibility have not yet been determined. However, it is likely that we will run the model for weekdays, Saturdays, and Sundays generally, and then during time periods that are likely to pose accessibility issues to patients, such as early mornings (i.e. before 9 am), lunch hours, and evenings (i.e. after 6 pm). Running this model for explicit time periods increases the granularity of our analysis and may drive a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial accessibility to pharmacy care across Vermont. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model is based on the Enhanced 2-Step Floating Catchment (E2SFCA) method, first developed by Luo and Qi (2009) to measure the spatial accesibility to primary care physicians. Since then, this method has been widely adopted to measure the spatial accessibility to a wide range of services; still, it appears to primarily be used to address access to healthcare resources. \n",
    "Background on the E2SFCA. Mention how we plan to adapt it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though there is some uncertainty in all that our analysis will entail, we are also interested in the relationship between social vulnerability and pharmacy access as well as the impact that independent versus chain pharmacies have on the accessibility landscape. Considering Vermont's aging population and the elderly's increased reliance on pharmaceuticals, we are interested in the relationship between the presence of elderly populations and pharmacy access, which is likely correlated with SVI as age is taken into account in this measure of vulnerability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specific statistical tests? Only to test hypothesis. \n",
    "- Simple t-test, is there a difference between urban and rural accesibility to pharmacy care, maybe weighted by population. \n",
    "- Metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural, see if there's statistically significant difference between groups. Plan to compare access across these groups at various time extents, presuming that there will be more extreme differences during extreme business hours - these classifications are by town, another justifcation to use towns for final maps as geographic unit\n",

The list of active pharmacies was sourced from the Vermont Office of Professional Regulation(OPR)and the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A list of all pharmacies within the study area was compiled by aggregating these data sources and checking them against Google Maps and OpenStreetMap. By conducting surveys, we verified the publicly available data regarding operational hours and gathered information on staffing levels. The residential dataset is sourced from the United States Census Bureau and contains information on the populations living in given census tracts and zipcodes (?), as well as the demographics of those tracts. The road network dataset is pulled from OpenStreetMap (OSM) using the OSMnx package in Python. \n",
