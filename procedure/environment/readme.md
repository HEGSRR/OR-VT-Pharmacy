## Computational environment setup instructions

This research was developed on the CyberGISX <https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/> computational environment for Jupyter notebooks running python with spatial analysis packages.
The Python 3-0.9.0 Kernel was used.
This Kernel uses Python version 3.8.12 and the following key packages:
numpy==1.22.0  
pandas==1.3.5  
geopandas==0.10.2  
networkx==2.6.3  
osmnx==1.1.2  
re==2.2.1  
folium==0.12.1.post1
